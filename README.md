so_long is a graphical game project at 42 where you create a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX graphics library. In this game, a player navigates through a small map, collecting items and reaching an exit while avoiding obstacles. The project introduces basic game mechanics, graphics rendering, and event handling.

Through this project, I learned how to:

-Use MiniLibX to render graphics and manage a game window

-Handle player input events like keyboard controls

-Implement a game map layout using a grid of tiles with images

-Apply memory management techniques to prevent leaks during gameplay

Program takes the .ber map file as argument.
